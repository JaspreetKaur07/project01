                <p>Outside of the world of fine collectibles, what’s old is trash, and what’s new is flashy and exciting. However, within the market for watches (and cars, and art, and furniture, for that matter), there’s a growing community of passionate enthusiasts who are fixated on details and fine distinctions, from aged luminous plots to patina to bracelets to lugs. In short, if you’ve spent much time around ‘watch people,’ you’ve probably met a collector or two who are obsessed with vintage pieces.</p>

                <p>Why do vintage watches generate this romantic intrigue, inspiring a following of dedicated nerds? To begin with, those who collect watches (of any kind) are often nostalgic people. Valuing watches for more than their immediate utility as tools, collectors form emotional connections with pieces and look to timepieces as a means through which to connect to the past. Furthermore, while such a pursuit was once the purview of an older crowd, more and more younger folks are breaking into the hobby.</p>

                <p>It’s always interesting to learn how these younger collectors wind up in the vintage space. For many, it begins with an heirloom watch passed on from a parent or grandparent. Oftentimes, these collectors never had any connection with the watch world prior, but are exposed to the other, less commercial side of the watch game, and one that isn’t focused on nearly enough — the emotional.</p>

                <p>There’s no doubt that watches are often statement pieces; for some, a watch is just a flashy accessory. (Indeed, with the popularity of all things "vintage" and with "thrifting" having become an amateur sport, the increased popularity of vintage watches as accessories is of little surprise.) At the same time, watches can be immensely personal, and a way to express individuality. While this aspect of collecting may not be as easily flaunt-able on social media, it’s no less important to watch collecting as a whole. Talking to big collectors today, you’d be surprised to learn just how many began their journey with a family member’s watch.</p>

                <p>Alongside the sentimental, there are a variety of aspects of vintage watches that are simply not available today with modern timepieces. Patina, for example, is often favored by vintage collectors. It’s difficult to describe precisely why the aging of white lume to crusty golden yellow is appealing, or why a faded aluminum bezel gets collectors’ hearts racing, but when holding a vintage watch, the attraction is undeniable. These timepieces have lived entire lives prior to your ownership — and they show it. This is a powerful emotional connection that new watches simply can't provide. Furthermore, collecting vintage watches is an opportunity to repair and reuse a product, which has its implications for the planet and tugs on its own set of emotional heartstrings for many consumers today.</p>
