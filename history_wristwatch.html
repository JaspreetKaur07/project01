                <p>Nothing has shaped our present understanding of time as much as the invention of the wristwatch. In everyday life, people wear it out of normality. In reality, wristwatches are two centuries old and have made a lot of development since its introduction.</p>
                <p>In the 15th century, balance and, above all, the spiral spring were created, which made the construction of precise watches possible. The coil spring replaced the long pendulum that was used in the past and thus created the foundations for a miniaturisation of the watches. In 1673 Christiaan Huygens created a watch with spiral spring and balance, which was already relatively small and portable.</p>
                <p>The way was paved for the development of smaller watches: Only a few decades later in 1812, Abraham-Louis Breguet made the first known wristwatch for Queen Caroline Murat, Napoleon’s sister. It was attached to the wrist with a strap.  By then, men carried their timepieces on a chain attached to their back pocket. Women wore it around their necks, a trend that lasted for almost a century. The wristwatch slowly found its way into social life, and at the end of the 19th century, it had a firm place in women’s wardrobes. Such watches were attached to ribbons or chains, giving them a feminine touch and making them look like jewels.
                    
                    <p>Although many series were designed for professional use, they did not remain reserved for military use and quickly became admired amongst the civilian population. But the era of the pocket watch was not over yet: for a long time there was a coexistence of pocket watch and wristwatch. But the rapid development of the wristwatch caused a growing popularity. It was initially worn mainly by soldiers and pilots who used the timepieces in the First World War. At the beginning, pocket watches were used, and were equipped with a chain. As time progressed, the market for wrist watches formed rapidly. The requirements of the war affected their features: Luminous hands for better readability, shockproof housings and scratch-resistant glasses are still important features today.</p>

                <p>In the 1920s, the first automatic, self-winding watch was developed. In 1926, Rolex made headlines when they introduced their waterproof Oyster case, which significantly contributed to their advertising campaign thanks to the success of wristwatches. To prove the waterproofness of the Oyster case, founder Hans Wilsdorf equipped swimmer Mercedes Gleitze with a Rolex as she tried to cross the English Channel. The record attempt failed because of unfavourable weather conditions. The watch survived its time in icy water without any damage. The success of the wristwatch was unstoppable. In 1931 Rolex launched the first self-winding movement, the Oyster Perpetual, replaced the hand-wound movement.</p>
